# Real-Time-Traffic-Control-System
## Basic Idea
It is a Real-Time Traffic-adaptive signal control system 
## Components Required
Arduino Nano/Uno, IR sensors, Breadboard Wires, Ribbon Wires, Breadboard, IC 7805, IC 7809, male to male wires, female to female wires.
## Design and Working
In our hardware model, we have used 6 IR's, 2 on two wider roads and 1 on two narrow roads. So according to the traffic detected at each IR sensor, we have created a delay function that basically generates a real time delay for each and every traffic light, and in clockwise direston, one by one every street light signals red light according to its delay.
## how to run
use Arduino IDE to upload this code in arduino.
